        <p class="body-text"> beauty salon presents an array of sculptures, site-specific installation, and works on paper by Berlin-based artist Sadie Weis. The sculptures are 3D printed versions of curious artifacts comprised of found industrial objects which are often partially crystallized or melted; they are simulacra which have taken on new properties as they have been reproduced, relocated, and manipulated by Weis in Los Angeles. Additionally, through an idiosyncratic monotype printing process she hybridizes painting and silkscreening to create otherworldly abstractions which emerge from vivid dream imagery and further play on ideas of simulation and reproducibility.        </p>

        <p class="body-text"> “Since 1970 I have recorded rivers in many countries, not to document them, but rather for the special state of mind and body which the sounds of moving water create when one listens intently to the complex mesh of rhythms and pitches.” </p>
