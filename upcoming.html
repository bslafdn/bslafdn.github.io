        <p class="body-text"> beuaty salon is proud to present the sock works of Robert Appleton. The show is comprised of 6 garments and a patchwork curtain alongside photographs by Amy Eckert which offer a contextual glance into Appleton's world of imaginative and often scathingly humorous performance. An early video collaboration with Peter Celli, Peter Shaprio, and Liz Watson will also be shown. The gallery would like to thank Amy Eckert, Peter Celli, and Appleton's Estate for their kind cooperation in producing this show.   </p>
