        <p class="body-text"> beauty salon presents NOT US, a group show featuring the recent sound work ‘NICHT WIR’ of eminent Berlin-based composer and multimedia artist Peter Ablinger. This piece for ‘two mutually affecting metal foils’ is an exercise in acoustic feedback which “seems to lead its own independent life. Each foil responds to the other, but the system as a whole also seems to respond to the environment.”  Acting as both speaker and microphone, one speaks what the other hears to create an ever-evolving interdependent duet. The Ablinger is paired with works by Davie Kaim, Paul Mpagi Sepuya, and Joey Strella which present figures in various states of abstraction and evoke ideas of kinship, mirroring, and the poetics of obfuscation.       </p>
