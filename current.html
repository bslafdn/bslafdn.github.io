 <p class="body-text"> beauty salon presents small music, a show of sound-oriented visual works by Peter Ablinger, Jennifer Calivas, Rolf Julius, Zachary Kenefick, Ellie Pyle, Dean Sameshima, and LeRoy Stevens, and a sound installation by Volker Straebel. The term ‘small music’ is borrowed from Rolf Julius to indicate acoustic experiences which are on the threshold of perception. Straebel’s installation embodies this idea directly, while the visual works gesture towards audibility in various ways—texts which describe sounds, photographs of recorded media, photograms made while dancing to a song, a sculptural evocation of a pop singer, a painting as an amplifier, noises so near to silence they must be imagined.
