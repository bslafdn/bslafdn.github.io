        <p class="body-text"> beauty salon presents NOT US, a group show featuring the recent sound work ‘NICHT WIR’ of eminent Berlin-based composer and multimedia artist Peter Ablinger. This piece for ‘two mutually affecting metal foils’ is an exercise in acoustic feedback which “seems to lead its own independent life. Each foil responds to the other, but the system as a whole also seems to respond to the environment.”  Acting as both speaker and microphone, one speaks what the other hears to create an ever-evolving interdependent duet. The Ablinger is paired with works by Davie Kaim, Paul Mpagi Sepuya, and Joey Strella which present figures in various states of abstraction and evoke ideas of kinship, mirroring, and the poetics of obfuscation.       </p>

        <p class="body-text"> beauty salon presents an array of sculptures, site-specific installation, and works on paper by Berlin-based artist Sadie Weis. The sculptures are 3D printed versions of curious artifacts comprised of found industrial objects which are often partially crystallized or melted; they are simulacra which have taken on new properties as they have been reproduced, relocated, and manipulated by Weis in Los Angeles. Additionally, through an idiosyncratic monotype printing process she hybridizes painting and silkscreening to create otherworldly abstractions which emerge from vivid dream imagery and further play on ideas of simulation and reproducibility.        </p>

 <p class="body-text"> beauty salon presents Annea Lockwood’s seminal installation A Sound Map of the Hudson River (1989) alongside various water-themed works by John Cage, Jennifer Calivas, Kostis Fokas, Kevin Ford, Clifford Prince King, Marie Lorenz, Valentina Rosset, Victoria Sambunaris, Pacifico Silano, and Lauren Strom-Berg.       </p>

        <p class="body-text"> beauty salon is proud to present the sock works of Robert Appleton. The show is comprised of 6 garments and a patchwork curtain alongside photographs by Amy Eckert which offer a contextual glance into Appleton's world of imaginative and often scathingly humorous performance. An early video collaboration with Peter Celli, Peter Shaprio, and Liz Watson will also be shown. The gallery would like to thank Amy Eckert, Peter Celli, and Appleton's Estate for their kind cooperation in producing this show.   </p>

        <img class="upcoming-img" src="starsongspress.2-1.jpg">  
        <p class="body-text">For its inaugural installation, beauty salon presents an iteration of an ongoing collaboration between LA-based artists Ellie Pyle and L. Castelvetro. This work grows out of their extensive correspondence and draws from ideas of celestial motion, painterly notions of the representation of 3D space on a 2D surface, the music of Baroque composer Heinrich Schütz, and explorations of non-linear co-temporalities. This show is comprised of 6 paintings, 6 co-existing synthesized sound environments, and several smaller works. </p>
