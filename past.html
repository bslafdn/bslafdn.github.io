<p class="body-text"> beauty salon presents ‘Cecile Bouchier & Yuan Gao: Bird Works’. Meant to be viewed at night, this show is comprised of works which stem from a deep connection with the Castaic region of Southern California. Bouchier has for decades made diorama boxes which depict dream-like scenes involving anthropomorphized birds, dried plant material, bee hives, ash, and found objects from around her home in the Mojave desert. Gao goes out into the mountains at night and exposes film to moonlight in uncanny ways; his recent film 12 birds and a frame presents short fragments which correspond to the hours on an ornithological novelty clock in the darkroom where the film was developed. It is presented alongside various mixed-media works, photographs, and drawings by Bouchier. </p>      </p>

        <p class="body-text"> Twenty-four speaker nests assembled from small wooden filing drawers, prepared with transducers, and filled with gravel of differing size, weight, and material. Each is driven by one of twelve channels of low-frequency noise, which rattles the particles in each drawer. <br> 
          <br>

The frequency, length, and intensity of shaking at each speaker increases and accelerates over the course of an hour in proportion to statistics tracking temperature, drought, and wildfire frequency in Southern California. The intensity of sound increases from single entrances in the first quarter of each hour to a constant roaring in the last, and we hear the proportional acceleration of climate change over the last seventy years. <br> <br> 

As we listen, we become aware that our seemingly static surroundings are changing, implacably, at scale and speed too slow and large to be grasped by an individual at an instant.       </p>

        <p class="body-text"> beauty salon presents NOT US, a group show featuring the recent sound work ‘NICHT WIR’ of eminent Berlin-based composer and multimedia artist Peter Ablinger. This piece for ‘two mutually affecting metal foils’ is an exercise in acoustic feedback which “seems to lead its own independent life. Each foil responds to the other, but the system as a whole also seems to respond to the environment.”  Acting as both speaker and microphone, one speaks what the other hears to create an ever-evolving interdependent duet. The Ablinger is paired with works by Davie Kaim, Paul Mpagi Sepuya, and Joey Strella which present figures in various states of abstraction and evoke ideas of kinship, mirroring, and the poetics of obfuscation.       </p>

        <p class="body-text"> beauty salon presents an array of sculptures, site-specific installation, and works on paper by Berlin-based artist Sadie Weis. The sculptures are 3D printed versions of curious artifacts comprised of found industrial objects which are often partially crystallized or melted; they are simulacra which have taken on new properties as they have been reproduced, relocated, and manipulated by Weis in Los Angeles. Additionally, through an idiosyncratic monotype printing process she hybridizes painting and silkscreening to create otherworldly abstractions which emerge from vivid dream imagery and further play on ideas of simulation and reproducibility.        </p>

        <p class="body-text">For its inaugural installation, beauty salon presents an iteration of an ongoing collaboration between LA-based artists Ellie Pyle and L. Castelvetro. This work grows out of their extensive correspondence and draws from ideas of celestial motion, painterly notions of the representation of 3D space on a 2D surface, the music of Baroque composer Heinrich Schütz, and explorations of non-linear co-temporalities. This show is comprised of 6 paintings, 6 co-existing synthesized sound environments, and several smaller works. </p>
