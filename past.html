        <p class="body-text"> “Since 1970 I have recorded rivers in many countries, not to document them, but rather for the special state of mind and body which the sounds of moving water create when one listens intently to the complex mesh of rhythms and pitches.” </p>

The show is comprised of 6 garments and a patchwork curtain alongside photographs by Amy Eckert which offer a contextual glance into Appleton's world of imaginative and often scathingly humorous performance. An early video collaboration with Peter Celli, Peter Shaprio, and Liz Watson will also be shown. The gallery would like to thank Amy Eckert, Peter Celli, and Appleton's Estate for their kind cooperation in producing this show.   </p>

        <p class="body-text">For its inaugural installation, beauty salon presents an iteration of an ongoing collaboration between LA-based artists Ellie Pyle and L. Castelvetro. This work grows out of their extensive correspondence and draws from ideas of celestial motion, painterly notions of the representation of 3D space on a 2D surface, the music of Baroque composer Heinrich Schütz, and explorations of non-linear co-temporalities. This show is comprised of 6 paintings, 6 co-existing synthesized sound environments, and several smaller works. </p>
